# US1900
=======================================


# 1. Requirements

**1900** As Project Manager, I intend that, for demonstration purposes, the system has the possibility of being initialized (bootstrap) with some information related to the product catalog and auxiliary information.

- 1900.1. Main goal: Have a system that always has information to show. 

- 1900.2. Functionalities: For example created products, categories and brands should persist in the system.

- 1900.3. Dependencies: More than what this part of the project is dependent on, it is more relavant to highlight how much the project is dependent on it. This US allows us to have information on the catalog each time the system is initialized.

# 2. Analysis
- 1. Concepts: there was the need to have a more in depth look at how the bootstrap works.

- 2. Organization: There was some confusion on how to integrate everythng needed with the base project, in terms of which packages to use for certain parts. 

- 3. Code: everytime the bootstrap is run it creates instances

# 3. Design

## 3.1. Applied standards

*This US does not have diagrams.*

# 4. Implementation

- When analysing the code it is possible to see how it is in accordance with the diagrams done for this US.

- Other files worth mentioning: files related with persistance

# 5. Integration/ Documentation

- The foundation was what was already in projeto.base, from there we just added some more code
