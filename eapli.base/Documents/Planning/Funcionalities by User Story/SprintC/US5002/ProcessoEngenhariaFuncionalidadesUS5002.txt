=======================================


# 1. Requirements

**5002** As Project Manager, I want that the team start developing the output communication module of the AGV digital twin to update its status on the "AGVManager".

- 5001.1. Main goal: The goal is to get the AGV digital twin to update the status of the AGV according to the request from the AGVManager.

- 5001.2. Functionalities: The AGV digital twin recieves a message from the AGVManager and changes the status accordingly.

- 5001.3. Dependencies: This US depends on the US 5001.

# 2. Analysis


- 1. **Concepts**:The AGVManager sends the information to the AGV digital twin and it changes the status of the AGV accordingly.

- 2. **Organization**:The AGV digital twin recieves the requests from the AGVManager and procedes to it's treatment, after that it will get the AGV and change it's status.

- 3. **Code**:A function was added that when a certain code is inserted it does the status change.
